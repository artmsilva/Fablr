## Objective

Fix the `/playroom` layout so the editor, preview, and inspector panels occupy the intended heights and the editor provides a usable multi-line canvas instead of collapsing to a single row.

## Deliverables

- [x] Diagnose the playroom layout collapse affecting the editor area.
- [x] Update layout/styles so editor + preview fill the column with proper scroll containment.
- [x] Confirm in-browser that the editor is fully usable and note any follow-up polish.

## Timeline

- `2025-11-29 11:30 EST` — **Layout fix**: Added min-height/height rules to playroom grid panels and converted the editor component to a flex column so the Monaco surface stretches under the toolbar; validated visually in `/playroom` (DevTools screenshot).
- `2025-11-29 11:45 EST` — **Bundle Monaco locally**: Swapped CDN loader for bundled `monaco-editor` ESM with worker wiring; reloaded `/playroom` to confirm editor initializes without external network.
- `2025-11-29 12:10 EST` — **Shadow DOM styling**: Cloned Monaco CSS into the editor shadow root so the input area renders correctly (line numbers, padding, hidden textarea). Ran `npm run build` to verify bundling.
- `2025-11-29 12:40 EST` — **Preview parsing fix**: Switched DSL parser to XML mode with self-closing recognition so multiple root nodes render separately in the preview.
- `2025-11-29 12:55 EST` — **Sample + palette fixes**: Updated playroom default sample to a complete form layout and corrected palette snippets (icon button uses slot glyph; select includes option children) so inserted code renders as expected.
- `2025-11-29 13:10 EST` — **Card slot fix**: Adjusted sample and palette card snippets to use the `title` prop and default slot (no named slots), restoring visible content in the preview.
- `2025-11-29 13:40 EST` — **Properties inspector MVP**: Added node IDs to preview output, inspector panel to edit props, and code regeneration flow; clicking preview elements populates editable props and updates the editor/preview.
- `2025-11-29 14:05 EST` — **Inspector polish**: Highlight selected nodes, allow adding/removing props, preserve token/args interpolations on edits, and keep selection synced. Build still passes.
- `2025-11-29 14:25 EST` — **Validation + UX**: Added hover/selection affordance, clear-selection control, boolean-friendly inputs, metadata-based warnings for unknown props/components, and interpolation-safe prop edits. Build still passes.
- `2025-11-29 14:45 EST` — **Overlay + toolbar warnings**: Added selection overlay, hover outline, toolbar-clear, warning bubble in preview for metadata issues; build still passes.

## Current Risks / Blockers

- Monaco bundle is large (~5MB ts worker) but build succeeds; consider chunking if size is a concern.

## Hand-off Notes

- Verified manually at `http://localhost:3000/playroom`; editor now spans the upper half with preview below. Inspector still placeholder-only.

## Outcome (fill in when Done)

- Pending final sign-off.
